# Here are some commonly used data preprocessing/cleaning methods in pandas:

    1. Handling Missing Data: Pandas provides methods to handle missing data, such as 
                                `isna()` to check for missing values, 
                                `fillna()` to fill missing values, 
                                & `dropna()` to drop rows or columns with missing data.

    2. Data Conversion: Pandas provides methods to convert data types, such as 
                                `astype()` to convert a column to a different data type 
                                & `to_datetime()` to convert a column to a datetime data type.


    3. Removing Duplicates: Pandas provides a `drop_duplicates()` method to remove duplicate rows from a DataFrame.


    4. Renaming Columns: Pandas provides a `rename()` method to rename columns in a DataFrame.


These are just some of the commonly used data preprocessing/cleaning methods in pandas. 

There are many more methods available in pandas to perform various data manipulation tasks.
