# NOTE: join() function is takes more time to be handy than merge() function.


# join():
            ==> The join() function in Pandas is a method used to combine two or more data frames based on the index or a key column. 
            
            ==> It is similar to the SQL join operation, where data from multiple tables are merged based on a common column.

        
        SYNTAX: df1.join(other, on=None, how='left', lsuffix='', rsuffix='', sort=False)
    


    # various parameters used in the join() function:

        other: This parameter specifies the DataFrame, Series or dict of DataFrames/Series to join with.

        on: This parameter specifies the column name or index level name(s) in the left DataFrame to join on. 
            It is optional and defaults to None, which means that the join will be based on the index of the left DataFrame.

        how: This parameter specifies the type of join to be performed, such as left, right, inner, or outer. 
            It is optional and defaults to 'left' join.

        lsuffix: This parameter specifies the suffix to be used for overlapping column names in the left DataFrame. 
                It is optional and defaults to an empty string.

        rsuffix: This parameter specifies the suffix to be used for overlapping column names in the right DataFrame. 
                It is optional and defaults to an empty string.

        sort: This parameter specifies whether to sort the resulting DataFrame by the join keys. 
                It is optional and defaults to False.
