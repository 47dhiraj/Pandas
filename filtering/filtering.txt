# Filtering: Filtering in a Pandas dataframe refers to the process of selecting a subset of data based on a specific condition or set of conditions. 
            In other words, filtering allows you to extract only the rows that meet certain criteria from a larger dataframe.


    ==> Filtering is commonly used in data analysis and manipulation to extract subsets of data that are relevant to a specific research question or analysis. 


    ==> For example, you may filter a dataframe to extract all rows where a certain column meets a certain filtering condition, such as selecting all rows where the value in the 'Age' column is greater than 30.

    ==> In Pandas, filtering is often accomplished using boolean indexing, which involves creating a boolean mask that selects the rows of interest and passing this mask to the dataframe using square brackets. 
        The result is a new dataframe that contains only the rows that meet the specified condition(s).



    # filter based on the 'Age' column label
        eg: filtered_df = df[df['Age'] > 25]
