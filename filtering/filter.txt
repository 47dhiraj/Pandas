# filter(): The filter() method in Pandas is a method that allows you to select a subset(certain portion/part) of columns from a dataframe based on their column labels or properties.


    ==> The filter() method takes several parameters that allow you to specify the columns you want to select based on their column labels or properties.

    ==> These parameters include:

        items: a list of column labels to select
        like: a string or regular expression pattern to match against the column labels
        regex: a regular expression pattern to match against the column labels
        axis: the axis along which to filter the columns (0 for rows and 1 for columns)
    

    # Example:  # select a subset of columns based on their column labels

                selected_columns = df.filter(items=['name', 'age'])
