# isin(): The isin() method in Pandas is a filtering method that allows you to select rows of a dataframe based on whether their values are contained within a specific set of values.

    NOTE: yedi various differnt condition/selection ko basis ma filtering garnu cha vani, isin() filtering method ko use garko ramro
    

    ==> The isin() method takes a list or an array of values as its argument and returns a boolean mask that indicates whether each element in a dataframe is present in the given list of values. 
        You can then use this boolean mask to filter the dataframe and select only the rows that contain the specified values.

    ==> Example: # filter the dataframe based on a list of values

        selected_cities = ['New York', 'Paris']
        filtered_df = df[df['city'].isin(selected_cities)]      # city is a column in which we are applying certain filtering condition
