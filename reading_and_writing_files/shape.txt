# df.shape: It returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame.

NOTE: It's important to note that df.shape is an attribute, not a method, so it doesn't require parentheses. 
        So, you would access it like df.shape rather than df.shape().


==> The df.shape attribute returns a tuple with two elements, where the first element is the number of rows in the DataFrame and the second element is the number of columns in the DataFrame. 
    So, df.shape returns the shape of the DataFrame in the format (number of rows, number of columns).


NOTE: This attribute is commonly used to check the size of a DataFrame and to ensure that data has been loaded correctly into the DataFrame. 


==> For example:
                You might use df.shape[0] to get the number of rows in the DataFrame 
                You might use df.shape[1] to get the number of columns in the DataFrame
