# loc and iloc are two indexing methods in Pandas used for selecting subsets of a DataFrame or Series.



# loc:  loc is primarily label based, which means it selects data based on the labels of rows and columns in the DataFrame. 
        You can use it to select rows or columns by label, or a combination of both.
    
SYNTAX ==>  df.loc[row_labels, column_labels]

            where row_labels and column_labels can be a single label, a list of labels, or a slice.




# iloc: iloc is primarily integer based, which means it selects data based on the integer position of rows and columns in the DataFrame. 
        You can use it to select rows or columns by integer position, or a combination of both. 

SYNTAX  ==> df.iloc[row_indices, column_indices] 

            where row_indices and column_indices can be a single integer, a list of integers, or a slice.



==> In summary, loc is used for label-based indexing, while iloc is used for integer-based indexing. 
    It's important to understand the differences between these two methods to avoid errors when selecting data from a DataFrame.
