# df.describe():    df.describe() is a method used to generate descriptive statistics of a DataFrame object df.


    ==> The df.describe() method returns a summary of statistics for each numerical column in the DataFrame

    ==> By default, it includes the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, 25th percentile, 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile, and maximum value of each numerical column.

    ==> The method also includes the include and exclude parameters that can be used to specify which columns to include or exclude from the summary statistics. For example, you can use df.describe(include='object') to generate summary statistics for all object (non-numerical) columns.


    In summary, df.describe() is commonly used to quickly understand the distribution and range of values of the numerical variables in a DataFrame, and to identify potential issues such as missing values or outliers.
